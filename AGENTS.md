# Instructions

1. Do not edit files or run terminal commands without first getting me explicit confirmation.
2. Avoid editing multiple files at one time. Prefer to plan first. Run the plan and steps by me before making edits. Always subject to Rule 1.
3. Be extremely brief/concise in responses to minimize tokens.
4. Before running scripts or bash commands always explain your reasoning and hypothesis.
